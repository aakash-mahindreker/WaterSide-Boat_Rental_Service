	- Enable Boat Rentals: Create an intuitive online platform that allows users to easily browse, search, and book boats for various purposes, such as fishing, cruising, or water sports.
	- Empower Boat Owners: Provide a dedicated dashboard for boat owners to list their boats, manage reservations, and maximize the utilization of their assets.
	- Ensure User Safety: Implement robust security measures and user authentication protocols to ensure the safety and privacy of users.
	- Streamline Payments: Integrate a secure payment gateway to handle transactions between customers and boat owners efficiently.
	- Enhance User Experience: Design an appealing and responsive user interface with advanced search and filtering capabilities to simplify the boat selection process.
	- Promote User Trust: Incorporate features for users to leave reviews and ratings, fostering trust and accountability within the Waterside community.

## 2. Introduction
- Boating has long been an integral part of leisure and recreation, offering individuals and families the chance to connect with nature, explore new destinations, and create cherished memories on the water. As the allure of water-based activities continues to captivate people of all ages, the demand for convenient and accessible boat rental services has seen a significant upsurge.


## 3. Project Scope

## 7. Design and Architecture

### Design Goals
- User-Centric: Prioritize the needs and preferences of end-users to ensure the platform is intuitive, accessible, and enjoyable to use.
- Responsive: The design should adapt seamlessly to various devices, including desktops, tablets, and smartphones, ensuring a consistent user experience.
- Aesthetic Consistency: Maintain a cohesive look and feel throughout the platform, aligning with Waterside's brand identity and enhancing brand recognition.
- Scalability: Design the platform in a way that it can easily accommodate future updates, additional features, or scaling up as Waterside grows.
- Efficiency: Optimize the design for quick loading times and smooth navigation, minimizing wait times for users.


### Design Approach
- Research & Discovery: Begin with a deep dive into understanding the target users, their preferences, pain points, and what they seek from a boat rental platform. This could involve surveys, interviews, and competitive analysis.
- Design Methodology - Iterative Design: Adopt an iterative design process, where designs are continuously refined based on feedback and testing. This ensures that the final design is optimized for the end-users.
- Framework - Design Thinking: Embrace the Design Thinking framework, which involves empathizing with users, defining their needs, ideating solutions, prototyping designs, and testing them.
- Wireframing: Before diving into detailed designs, create wireframes for the platform. This provides a skeletal framework of the platform, laying out the structure and flow.
- Prototyping: Develop clickable prototypes to simulate the user journey and interactions within the platform. Tools like Figma or Adobe XD can be used for this purpose.
- User Testing: Test the prototypes with actual users to gather feedback. This step is crucial in identifying design flaws or areas of improvement.
- Final Design & Handoff: After several iterations and refining the design based on feedback, finalize the design. Ensure that the design is well-documented and hand it off to the development team for implementation.

## 8. Implementation
When it comes to implementing a comprehensive platform like Waterside, a combination of robust frameworks, tools, and libraries will be necessary to achieve efficiency, scalability, and a seamless user experience.

<img width="1581" alt="image" src="https://github.com/aakash-mahindreker/WaterSide/assets/70765660/21465fc3-8e5f-497f-bfb0-c654461f26df">

- Frontend Development
	- Bootstrap or Tailwind CSS: Frameworks that provide pre-styled components and utilities to speed up the design and ensure responsive design.

- Backend Development
	- Flask: A micro-framework that allows you to run Python on the server-side. It's fast and scalable.
	- GraphQL or RESTful APIs: For creating flexible and optimized APIs for data exchange between frontend and backend.


- Database
	- MongoDB: A NoSQL database that's flexible and scalable. It's especially useful if the data structure is expected to evolve over time.

- Payment Gateway Integration
	- Stripe: To enable online payments on the platform. Both are secure and widely recognized.

- Authentication and Security
	- JWT (JSON Web Tokens): For secure user authentication.
	- OAuth: To integrate third-party sign-ins (like Google or Facebook), if needed.
	- bcrypt: A library to help hash passwords, adding an extra layer of security.

- Version Control and Collaboration
	- Git: For version control, allowing multiple developers to work on the project simultaneously (in my code, for code backup).
	- GitHub or Bitbucket: Platforms for hosting the code repository and facilitating collaboration.

- Continuous Integration & Deployment
	- Jenkins or CircleCI: Tools that help automate parts of the development process.
	- Docker: For containerization, ensuring that the app runs the same way in every environment.

- Cloud Hosting and Services
	- AWS, Google Cloud, or Azure: These platforms offer a range of services, from virtual servers to database hosting, and can scale with the platform's growth.

- Testing and Quality Assurance
	- Cypress or Selenium: For end-to-end testing, ensuring the entire application works seamlessly.

### Test Screenshots taken while testing using Selenium: Refer the test folder in repository.

## 10. Maintenance
- Stripe payments require real business for accepting payments and generating folios.
- Payments, Authorizations and disputes can be applied in the future updates.
- Current reservations and reservation history can be accessed using transaction id or confirmation through accounts in the next update.
- Owners can see overall earnings and upcoming reservations through the account in the next update.
- The current app version is developed for small scale businesses for same day reservations and not for large scale businesses.
- Payments database capture and store successful payments.
- In future updates, customers will be able to read and create reviews of the boat.

## 11. Conclusion
- WaterSide: Boat Rental Service is a small scale business, where owners can rent their boat to the customers who are looking for the boat in the same location, on the same day. 


## 12. Recommendations
- This web app does not verify the customer's boating license and does not include insurance coverage.
- Since the only way to get the credentials is through using email, the email provided while login must be accessible to the owner or customer.
